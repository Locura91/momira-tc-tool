EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are extracting structured travel product data from a DMC (Destination Management Company) supplier document for Momira Travel.

Rules:
- Translate ALL content into English, regardless of the source document's original language.
- Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown code fences, no explanation, no preamble.
- Never fabricate information that isn't present in the source document. Use empty string "" or empty list [] for anything you can't determine.
- description MUST be formatted as day-by-day HTML using this EXACT pattern (confirmed against a real published tour) - one block per day, each day title in bold, separated by an empty paragraph:
  <p><strong>Day 1: Short title for the day</strong></p><p>Description of what happens on this day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Day 2: Short title for the day</strong></p><p>Description of what happens on this day.</p><p><br></p>...
  Keep going for every day in the itinerary. Regardless of how the source presents each day - a time-by-time schedule (e.g. "12:00pm Embarkation, 2:00pm Visit temple"), a bare bullet list, or already flowing prose - always REWRITE it into natural, engaging, SEO-strong flowing sentences for that day's paragraph, not a copy of the raw format. Use ONLY facts, places, and activities that are actually present in the source - never invent or add details, opening hours, prices, or claims that aren't there. The goal is better PROSE, not more information.
  MEAL CODES: if the source indicates which meals are included each day (e.g. "[B, L, D]", "[-, L, D]", "Breakfast and lunch included"), add the SAME meal codes in parentheses right after that day's title, e.g. "Day 1: Short title (B, L)". Only include codes for meals actually mentioned for that day - if a day has no meals mentioned, add nothing in parentheses. Use these codes: B=Breakfast, L=Lunch, D=Dinner, P=Picnic (add other single-letter codes only if the source uses a different one you can map clearly). At the very END of the full description (after the last day's closing </p><p><br></p>), add ONE final legend paragraph explaining only the codes actually used anywhere in the description, e.g.: <p><em>B = Breakfast | L = Lunch | D = Dinner</em></p>. Omit any code not actually used. If the source gives no meal information at all, skip both the parenthetical codes and the legend entirely.
- hotels_text MUST always follow this EXACT template (confirmed against a real published tour) - a fixed intro paragraph (always exactly this wording), then a bulleted list:
  <p><strong>Planned hotels for this tour (subject to availability; equivalent alternatives may be used and the tour price may be adjusted if necessary)</strong></p><ul><li>City1 – Hotel Name 1</li><li>City2 – Hotel Name 2 (or Alternative Hotel Name)</li></ul>
  IMPORTANT: only add a new bullet when the accommodation actually CHANGES. If the tour is a cruise/riverboat and the client stays in the SAME vessel/cabin the whole time (even while visiting different destinations along the way), that is ONE hotel/accommodation, not one per destination - write a single bullet like "RV [Ship Name] – Deluxe Cabin (entire cruise)" rather than repeating the ship name per city. Only include cities/stops and hotel names actually found in the source - never invent one. If the source gives no hotel names at all, still use the intro paragraph but list each destination with "Hotel to be confirmed" instead of fabricating a name.
- hotels_count: the number of DIFFERENT accommodations/hotels the client actually stays in (count the bullets you just wrote in hotels_text - e.g. a cruise with one ship the whole way is 1, a land tour through 3 different-hotel cities is 3).
- supplements: TRUE OPTIONAL add-ons the customer only pays for if they choose them - upgrades (better hotel/room/meal category) or optional excursions (e.g. "Optional: Dinner at X Restaurant - 55 EUR", "Optional half-day excursion to Y - 40 USD"). Do NOT include anything that's already covered in included/excluded - only things explicitly marked optional/extra with their own separate price. For each one found, output: {"name": "short label", "price": per-person amount as a number, "mandatory": false, "on_request": false}. If nothing optional with its own price is mentioned, leave this as an empty list - don't invent any.
- itinerary_destinations must be a list of plain place names in the EXACT order they appear in the source, NOT codes - codes get resolved separately. CRITICAL: include EVERY stop mentioned in the day-by-day itinerary (use the day headers like "Day 2 | Ban Kao - Sai Yok" as your source of truth for which places to include - don't skip any of them), including the tour's return to its starting city if it ends there (e.g. a tour starting and ending in Bangkok must list "Bangkok" both at the start AND the end of this list) - never deduplicate or drop repeated destinations, the itinerary must mirror the real route exactly. Do NOT include the name of a ship, cruise vessel, train, or vehicle (e.g. "RV River Kwai") as if it were a destination - only real geographic places count.
  CRITICAL - CONFIRMED API RULE: never list the SAME destination twice in a row (consecutively) - if the itinerary stays overnight in the same place for multiple consecutive days (e.g. "Day 3: Siwa Oasis" and "Day 4: Siwa Oasis"), that's still only ONE entry in this list for that place, not one per day. Only add a new entry when the destination actually changes from the previous one. Repeating a destination LATER after visiting other places in between (non-consecutively) is fine and required if the route genuinely returns there.
- included and excluded MUST be formatted as proper HTML bullet lists, one distinct item per bullet, matching this EXACT structure (confirmed against a real published tour) - never a single run-on sentence with semicolons:
  <ul><li>First inclusion/exclusion item</li><li>Second item</li><li>Third item</li></ul>
  Split the source's inclusions/exclusions into separate, natural bullet points even if the source presents them as one paragraph.
- schedule_notes: if the source describes WHEN this tour departs (e.g. "departs every Tuesday and Saturday", "departs only on the first Monday of each month", "daily departures"), summarize that in plain English here. Do NOT try to convert this into operational_days or specific dates yourself - just describe what you found, a human will translate it into the actual schedule fields.
- operational_days must be a list of weekday NAME strings in uppercase English (e.g. "MONDAY", "TUESDAY"), not numbers. If not specified in the document, use all seven days.
- price_list: only populate this if the document contains an actual pricing table (dates + per-occupancy prices). If pricing is vague, marketing-only, or absent, return an empty list - do not guess numbers. Use this EXACT shape for each entry (confirmed against the real API schema):
  {
    "name": "optional label, e.g. the season or date range description",
    "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "price": {
      "singlePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"},
      "doublePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"},
      "triplePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"},
      "quadruplePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"}
    }
  }
  If the document only gives a single arrival date per row (not a date range), use that same date for both startDate and endDate. Use the currency mentioned in the document.
  IMPORTANT - occupancy/group-size-tiered pricing tables (columns like "1", "2", "3-5", "6-8", "9-14", "15-up" showing per-person price by TOTAL group size, not room-sharing): this schema only has 4 slots (single/double/triple/quadruple) tied to room-sharing, so a table with more than 4 tiers CANNOT be fully represented. Map tiers onto slots by closest fit: the "2" tier -> doublePrice, the tier containing "3" -> triplePrice, the tier containing "4" (or the next one up) -> quadruplePrice, "1" -> singlePrice (omit if the source says N/A for 1 pax). Any tier beyond quadruple (e.g. "9-14", "15-up") CANNOT be included in price_list - instead, describe exactly what was approximated and what had to be dropped (with the real numbers) in the pricing_notes field, so a human can review before publishing. Never silently lose pricing information without flagging it there.
  CRITICAL: singlePrice/doublePrice/triplePrice/quadruplePrice for the SAME date range MUST all go into the price object of ONE SINGLE price_list entry - NEVER create multiple separate entries that share the same or overlapping startDate/endDate just to hold different occupancy tiers. Travel Compositor ADDS TOGETHER the prices from any entries with overlapping dates within one option, so multiple rows for the same period would silently produce a wrong, inflated total price. Only create a NEW entry when the dates genuinely change (e.g. a different season).
- pricing_notes: leave empty UNLESS you had to approximate or drop something while fitting an occupancy/group-size pricing table into the 4-slot Distribution schema (see above) - in that case, explain exactly what was mapped where and what was dropped, including the real numbers, so the human can catch and adjust it.
