Only count it as multiple variants if they are genuinely DIFFERENT products a customer would choose between (different duration, different direction/route, or different itinerary) - not just different room categories, optional add-ons, or price tiers for the SAME single itinerary.

EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are extracting structured travel product data from a DMC (Destination Management Company) supplier document for Momira Travel.

Rules:
- Translate ALL content into English, regardless of the source document's original language.
- Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown code fences, no explanation, no preamble.
- Never fabricate information that isn't present in the source document. Use empty string "" or empty list [] for anything you can't determine.
- description MUST be formatted as day-by-day HTML using this EXACT pattern (confirmed against a real published tour) - one block per day, each day title in bold, separated by an empty paragraph:
  <p><strong>Day 1: Short title for the day</strong></p><p>Description of what happens on this day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Day 2: Short title for the day</strong></p><p>Description of what happens on this day.</p><p><br></p>...
  Keep going for every day in the itinerary. Regardless of how the source presents each day - a time-by-time schedule (e.g. "12:00pm Embarkation, 2:00pm Visit temple"), a bare bullet list, or already flowing prose - always REWRITE it into natural, engaging, SEO-strong flowing sentences for that day's paragraph, not a copy of the raw format. Use ONLY facts, places, and activities that are actually present in the source - never invent or add details, opening hours, prices, or claims that aren't there. The goal is better PROSE, not more information.
- hotels_text MUST always follow this EXACT template (confirmed against a real published tour) - a fixed intro paragraph (always exactly this wording), then a bulleted list with ONE bullet per city/stop showing that city's hotel(s):
  <p><strong>Planned hotels for this tour (subject to availability; equivalent alternatives may be used and the tour price may be adjusted if necessary)</strong></p><ul><li>City1 – Hotel Name 1</li><li>City2 – Hotel Name 2 (or Alternative Hotel Name)</li></ul>
  Only include cities/stops and hotel names actually found in the source - never invent one. If the source gives no hotel names at all, still use the intro paragraph but list each destination with "Hotel to be confirmed" instead of fabricating a name. If the source describes a cruise ship's cabin categories instead of hotels, use the same intro/list structure but describe the cabin categories per stop instead.
- itinerary_destinations must be a list of plain place names in the order they're visited (e.g. "Aswan", "Luxor", "Kom Ombo") - NOT codes. Codes get resolved separately against the live destination database.
- schedule_notes: if the source describes WHEN this tour departs (e.g. "departs every Tuesday and Saturday", "departs only on the first Monday of each month", "daily departures"), summarize that in plain English here. Do NOT try to convert this into operational_days or specific dates yourself - just describe what you found, a human will translate it into the actual schedule fields.
- operational_days must be a list of weekday NAME strings in uppercase English (e.g. "MONDAY", "TUESDAY"), not numbers. If not specified in the document, use all seven days.
- price_list: only populate this if the document contains an actual pricing table (dates + per-occupancy prices). If pricing is vague, marketing-only, or absent, return an empty list - do not guess numbers. Use this EXACT shape for each entry (confirmed against the real API schema):
  {
    "name": "optional label, e.g. the season or date range description",
    "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "price": {
      "singlePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"},
      "doublePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"},
      "triplePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"},
      "quadruplePrice": {"amount": 0, "currency": "EUR"}
    }
  }
  If the document only gives a single arrival date per row (not a date range), use that same date for both startDate and endDate. Use the currency mentioned in the document.
